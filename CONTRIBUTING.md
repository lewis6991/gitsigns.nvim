**Please do not raise PR's for new features, only bug fixes will be reviewed.**

## Requirements

- [Luarocks](https://luarocks.org/)
    - `brew install luarocks`

## Generating docs

Most of the documentation is handwritten however the documentation for the configuration is generated from `lua/gitsigns/config.lua` which contains the configuration schema.
The help file is generated by `gen_help.lua` and uses `emmylua_doc_cli` to extract API documentation from the Lua sources.

The documentation can be updated with:

```bash
make doc
```

## Testsuite

The testsuite uses the same framework as Neovims functionaltest suite.
This is just busted with lots of helper code to create headless neovim instances which are controlled via RPC.

To run the testsuite:

```bash
make test
```
